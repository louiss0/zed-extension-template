# Zed Extension Template

This template uses placeholder author details because it is public.
Run the script below to set your real credentials.

## Setup

```bash
./scripts/set-credentials.sh "Your Name" "you@example.com" 2024
```

## Notes

- This template is designed to live under a zed-extensions parent so it works
  with your sync script.
